//Hereâ€™s the idea:
//
//Use two pointers, left and right, to represent the boundaries of the current substring.
// Use a HashSet to store the characters in the current substring for quick lookup of duplicates.
//
//Start with both pointers at the beginning of the string.
//
//Expand the window by moving the right pointer one step at a time, and adding characters to the set.
//
//If a duplicate character is encountered (already in the Set),
// shrink the window by moving the left pointer until the duplicate is removed from the substring.
//
//By shrinking the window with the left pointer, we ensure that the substring remains valid.
//
//After each adjustment, calculate the length of the current substring (right - left + 1)
// and update the maximum length if needed.
//
//When the right pointer reaches the end, return the maximum length of the substring.
